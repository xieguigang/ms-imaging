Title: Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data Processing and Visualization Toolkit
Version: 0.1.0
Author: xieguigang
Maintainer: xieguigang <gg.xie@bionovogene.com>
Description: Provides comprehensive pipelines for processing and visualizing mass
    spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. Key features include:
    - Intelligent intensity filtering (TrIQ scaling, kNN imputation, spatial smoothing)
    - Multi-modal visualization (heatmap matrices, RGB channel overlays, spatial coordinates)
    - Embedded statistical analysis integration (ANOVA group testing with imaging overlay)
    - Customizable preprocessing pipelines with geometric filters
    - Adaptive canvas sizing with CSS-style layout controls
    Built on 'ggplot2' grammar for layered visualization and 'mzkit' for mass spec
    data handling. Supports both exploratory analysis and publication-quality figure
    generation for MSI workflows.
