.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
annotation_raster: Annotation: high-performance rectangular tiling
 
 This is a special version of geom_raster() optimised for static 
 annotations that are the same in every panel. These annotations 
 will not affect scales (i.e. the x and y axes will not grow to cover 
 the range of the raster, and the raster must already have its own 
 colours). This is useful for adding bitmap images.
