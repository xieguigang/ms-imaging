### Color Blindness
 
 Many color palettes derived from RGB combinations (Like 
 the "rainbow" color palette) are Not suitable To support 
 all viewers, especially those With color vision 
 deficiencies. 
 
 Using viridis type, which Is perceptually uniform In both 
 colour And black-And-white display Is an easy Option To 
 ensure good perceptive properties Of your visulizations. 
 The colorspace package offers functionalities.
 
 to generate color palettes with good perceptive properties,
 
 to analyse a given color palette, Like emulating color 
 blindness,
 
 And to modify a given color palette for better perceptivity.
 
 For more information on color vision deficiencies And 
 suitable color choices see the paper on the colorspace 
 package And references therein.
