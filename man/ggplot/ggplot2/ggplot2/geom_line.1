.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Connect observations
 
 geom_path() connects the observations in the order in which they appear in 
 the data. geom_line() connects them in order of the variable on the x axis. 
 geom_step() creates a stairstep plot, highlighting exactly when changes 
 occur. The group aesthetic determines which cases are connected together.

 to a single case which provides the start and end coordinates.
