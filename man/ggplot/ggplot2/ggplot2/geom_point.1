.SH DESCRIPTION

Scatter Points
 
 The point geom is used to create scatterplots. The scatterplot is most 
 useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables. 
 It can be used to compare one continuous and one categorical variable, 
 or two categorical variables, but a variation like geom_jitter(), 
 geom_count(), or geom_bin2d() is usually more appropriate. A bubblechart 
 is a scatterplot with a third variable mapped to the size of points.
