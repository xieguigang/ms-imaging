.TH NPIXELS 1 2025-Aug "" "Count the number of MS1 scans as imaging pixels"
.SH NAME
npixels \- npixels(raw)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fInpixels(raw)\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function calculates the total number of MS1 scans in an mzpack object,
which corresponds to the pixel dimensions in MS imaging spatial data.
Each MS1 scan represents a spatial coordinate (pixel) in the 2D imaging plane.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBraw\fB \fR\- . An mzpack object containing mass spectrometry data. The object must
include MS1-level scan data in its MS property. Typically generated by
mzR or other MS data parsers that support imaging data structure.
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
An integer value representing the total number of pixels in the
associated MS imaging experiment. This is equivalent to the number of MS1
scans stored in the MS property of the input object.
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
The function accesses the MS property of the mzpack object, which stores
a list of MS scans, and returns the count of MS1-level scans. In MS imaging,
each MS1 scan is spatially mapped to a specific (x,y) coordinate, forming
the basis for intensity-based image reconstruction.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
#\dontrun{

# Assuming 'mzpack_data' is a valid mzpack object
pixel_count <- npixels(mzpack_data)
cat("Total imaging pixels:", pixel_count)

#}
