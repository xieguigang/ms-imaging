.TH DEFAULT_MSIFILTER 1 2025-Apr "" "Create Default Filter Pipeline for Single Ion Mass Spectrometry Imaging"
.SH NAME
default_MSIfilter \- default_MSIfilter()
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIdefault_MSIfilter()\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates a predefined pipeline of geometric filters optimized for preprocessing single ion mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. This pipeline combines multiple image enhancement steps in a recommended sequence.
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
A filter pipeline object of class 'geometric_filters' containing the configured processing sequence. This object can be used with MSI processing functions that accept geometric filter pipelines.
.PP
.SH DETAILS
.PP
The filter pipeline is constructed using the following processing steps in sequence: \enumerate{ \item \code{denoise_scale()}: Applies initial noise reduction to raw MSI data \item \code{TrIQ_scale(0.99)}: Performs trimmed quantile scaling (top 1% truncated) \item \code{knn_scale()}: Executes k-nearest neighbors smoothing \item \code{soften_scale()}: Final edge-preserving image softening } The 'greater than' operator (>) is used to define processing order in this domain-specific language. Filters are applied from left to right.
