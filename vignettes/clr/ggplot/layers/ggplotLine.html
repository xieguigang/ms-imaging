        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A line chart, also known as a line plot or line graph, is a type of chart used to display the trend, progress, 
 or change over time or between different conditions or categories. It is one of the most common and simple 
 methods for visualizing data sequences. Here's an introduction to the components and purposes of a line chart:
 
 ### Components of a Line Chart:
 
 1. <strong>Horizontal Axis (X-axis):</strong> This axis typically represents the independent variable, often time, which is placed on the horizontal line. Each point on the axis corresponds to a specific point in time or a category.
 2. <strong>Vertical Axis (Y-axis):</strong> This axis represents the dependent variable, which is the data that is being measured or tracked. The scale on the y-axis can be linear or logarithmic, depending on the range and distribution of the data.
 3. <strong>Lines:</strong> These are the curves or straight lines that connect the data points. Each line usually represents a different data series or category.
 4. <strong>Data Points:</strong> These are the individual markers on the chart that indicate the value of the dependent variable at a specific point on the x-axis. They can be represented by dots, squares, or other symbols.
 5. <strong>Legend:</strong> When multiple data series are represented on the same chart, a legend is used to explain what each line represents.
 
 ### Purposes of a Line Chart:
 
 - <strong>Show Trends:</strong> Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time, such as the stock market performance, temperature changes, or website traffic.
 - <strong>Compare Data Series:</strong> They can be used to compare the performance of different groups or categories over the same period.
 - <strong>Highlight Patterns:</strong> Line charts can reveal patterns such as cycles, trends, seasonality, or irregularities in the data.
 - <strong>Forecasting:</strong> By identifying trends, line charts can be used as a tool for making predictions about future data points.
 
 Line charts are versatile and can be used in a wide range of fields, including business, economics, science, and
 education, to present data in a clear and concise manner.</p>
